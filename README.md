# Machine-Learning-using-Python
This repository is mainly the outcome of my learnings from Machine Learning A-Z course on Udemy.<br>
<br>
This repository is going to have 9 parts:<br>
1. [Regression](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/1.%20Regression)
2. [Classification](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/2.%20Classification)
3. [Clustering](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/3.%20Clustering) 
4. [Associate Rule Learning](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/4.%20Associate%20Rule%20Learning)
5. [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/5.%20Reinforcement%20Learning)
6. [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/6.%20Natural%20Language%20Processing)
7. [Deep Learning](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/7.%20Deep%20Learning)
8. [Dimentionality Reduction](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/8.%20Dimentionality%20Reduction)
9. [Model Selection](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/9.%20Model%20Selection)

I hope it serves as a reference to fellow ML enthusiasts.<br>
I've tried to include as much theory as possible for reference and understanding.<br>
