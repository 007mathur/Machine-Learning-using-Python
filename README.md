# Machine-Learning-using-Python
This repository is the outcome of my learnings from Machine Learning A-Z course on Udemy.<br>
The work on this repository is in progress.<br>
<br>
This repository is going to have 9 parts:<br>
1. [Regression](https://github.com/dochimekashiariri/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/Regression)
2. Classification
3. Clustering 
4. Associate Rule Learning
5. Reinforcement Learning
6. Natural Language Processing
7. Deep Learning
8. Dimentionality Reduction
9. Model Selection

Currently, I'm working on the 1<sup>*st*</sup> part. With time all the 9 parts will be uploaded on the repository.<br>
I hope it serves as a reference to fellow ML enthusiasts.
