# Regression
<br>
Regression is a technique for determining the statistical relationship between two or more variables where a change in a dependent variable is associated with, and depends on, a change in one or more independent variables. <br>
<br>
Mathematically it can be expressed as: <br>
y = f(X) 
<br>where, y is dependent variable and X is matrix of independent variables.<br>
<br>
There are many effective ways of conducting regression analysis some of which we've discussed here:<br>
